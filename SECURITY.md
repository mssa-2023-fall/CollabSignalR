We take security issues seriously and value the input of independent security researchers and our user community. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in our software, we encourage you to notify us.

Email: Please send your findings to victorCSO@CollabSignalR.com. 
If possible, encrypt your findings using our PGP key to ensure the confidentiality of your report.
Format: 
Clearly mention the affected version, a detailed description of the vulnerability, and steps to reproduce (if applicable). Including any proof-of-concept code or screenshots can be helpful!

## What to expect
Acknowledgment: We aim to acknowledge your vulnerability report within 2 business days of receipt.
Assessment: We will assess the report and determine its impact on our project. We aim to verify and reproduce any valid issues within a week.

Updates: We will keep you informed about the progress of addressing the vulnerability. Depending on its complexity, it might take time, but we will endeavor to roll out patches or mitigations as soon as possible.

Disclosure: Once the issue is resolved, or if a predetermined public disclosure date is agreed upon, the vulnerability details will be shared with the community. We appreciate responsible disclosure and will give credit to the reporter unless anonymity is requested.

## Note
Please avoid public disclosure of the vulnerability before it has been addressed. Doing so can put the entire community at risk.
